# Bio
Dr. Nathanael L. Baisa is currently a Senior Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the School of Computer Science and Informatics, De Montfort University (DMU), and a consultant as a Senior Machine Learning scientist for different companies. Before joining DMU in June 2021 as a Lecturer in AI, he was a senior research associate at Lancaster university (Oct 2020 – May 2021), a research scientist at Oosto (Feb 2019 – Aug 2020) and a research fellow at university of Lincoln (Oct 2017 – Dec 2018), all in computer vision and machine learning, where he participated as a main researcher in many research projects funded by ERC (under EU’s horizon 2020), EPSRC and Innovate UK. Hence, he has developed extensive experience in computer vision and machine learning, having worked in both industry and academia.

Dr. Nathanael received his PhD in Electrical Engineering (with focus on Computer Vision and Machine Learning) from Heriot-Watt university, UK, in 2018 and his MSc in Computer Vision and Robotics (VIBOT) with distinction from three universities (European Erasmus Mundus): Burgundy University in France, Girona University in Spain and Heriot-Watt University in the UK, in 2013. He also received his BSc in Electrical Engineering with great distinction from Mekelle University, Ethiopia, in 2008.

His research interests include computer vision and machine learning, with current research emphasis on deep learning and Bayesian algorithms for solving computer vision (both 2D and 3D) problems such as object detection, recognition, tracking, scene understanding using multimodal learning (vision, language, etc.), generative AI (e.g. image synthesis), etc. for different applications such as intelligent video surveillance, biometrics, autonomous driving, robot perception, healthcare, etc. His work has been published in top-tier international journals, such as IEEE Access, Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, and Digital Signal Processing. He has also published and presented at leading computer vision conferences, including ICPR, IPTA, VISAPP, IWBF and FUSION. He serves as a committee member or technical chair for international conferences.
